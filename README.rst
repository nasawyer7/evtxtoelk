EvtxtoElk
============

A lightweight tool to load Windows Event Log evtx files into Elasticsearch. 

This also includes my configuration on windows as well, which is much less flushed out. 

Examples
--------

Blog is initially avaliable here, it is slightly out of date but credit goes to the original authors: https://web.archive.org/web/20221209023101/https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/evtxtoelk-a-python-module-to-load-windows-event-logs-into-elasticsearch/

I have now updated this script a bit. It now can parse folders or single files correctly. Also, now it will succeed in parsing timestamps from sysmon logs. Please let me know if there are any errors when using it. Email me at nathan@nathan2.com. 

Usage: 
python3 evtxtoelk.py ~/Downloads/ http://elastic:password@ip:9200  -i unit42

Downloads is the folder with evtx files to parse. You can also point at a single file. 
Change the password and ip to match your instance. 
i is the index. By default, it will upload to hostlogs if not specified.

Do not create the index first, this tool will do that. 

Data view creation
--------
Once the upload is finished, go to elk (kibana, port 5601) -> analytics -> discover.
In the top left, select the drop down to data views, and select create a data view. 

In the index pattern field, enter in the index that you specified with -i in the command. If you didn't specify an index, use hostlog. 
The name and timestamp field should autofill. Press save data view to kibana. 


Windows Config
--------
Download Winlogbeats and extract the zip to program files. 
Create your folder where you wish to put your windows logs at. In my case, I created it at C:\Logs_Drop_Folder
Put the dropper.ps1 script within that folder, and adjust any possible folder names at the top of the script. 
Place the evtx-ingest.yml script within the winlogbeats folder in program files. Adjust to point to your correct IP and username and password. 

Now, you are ready for normal use! Simply place your evtx logs in the Logs drop folder, and then run the dropper.ps1 script. It should upload all of your logs and move them to a seperate folder when done. I will likely add index management to this script later.
